I would prefer to run the program in Real Mode (16-bit addressing mode).
Following is the justification:

  - More often than not, embedded systems are tasked with only one single task,
  that is predecided. The embedded system can be hard-coded any program without
  the need for revision, or cater to other more dynamic program problems. This
  realisation has two implications:
    - Since mostly a single task needs to be performed, there isn't a
    requirement for a multitasking system, which is available to us via the long
    mode. - Secondly, since the system and program will not have a very dynamic
    nature, we can hard code addresses into the program itself, and use the
    absolute addressing capability of real mode.

  - 320KB is a very, very limited RAM capacity. Any space inside it must be used
  judiciously. 320KB does not allow the the possibility of having a cache. Thus,
  by keeping the wordsize at 16bits, we are able to allow our program 4 times
  more words than long mode's 64-bit.

  - 320KB is well within the maxmimum 1MiB addressing capability of real mode.
  All addresses in the RAM can be directly and absolutely accessed.

  - Long mode capabilities of paging real memory locations into the virtual
  space are not of immediate requirement to an embedded system with such low
  capacity.
